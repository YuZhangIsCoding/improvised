[Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html#) is a matplotlib toolkit 
for plotting 2D data on maps in Python.

in Statesmap.py, where customized settings use specified to cover all states
(except DC and Puerto Rico). With this class object, one can simply input a
data as a dictionary and the final figure looks like the figure below:
